\subsection{Classifying Spectra}
\subsubsection{Simple Spectrum Classification}
After training the model was tested on a ``base case'', that is accumulated spectrum of copper PCB as shown in \prettyref{fig:spectra-comparison}.
The output probabilities are visible on \prettyref{fig:copper-pcb-classification}.

\end{figure}

In this simple case, the results are satisfactory.

\subsubsection{Classification Of Clustered Spectra}
Now, considering that the model is far from ideal, the results of clustered spectra classification will be shown. 
Spectra were clustered, accumulated and preprocessed as presented in \prettyref{sec:clustered-spectra}.
In the last step they were classified and probability maps for each element were visualized.
Due to probabilistic nature the maps they do not provide any quantitative information! 
Results are visible in \prettyref{fig:clusters-prob-sobieski}, \prettyref{fig:clusters-prob-gasecki} and \prettyref{fig:clusters-prob-matka-boska}.

God with the Child Eating an Apple''}
  \label{fig:clusters-prob-matka-boska}
\end{figure}

As expected, many false positives appeared in probability maps.
On the other hand results are not \emph{very} tragic. 
As one can see in \prettyref{fig:lach-comparison}, Pb was detected pretty well.
Little worse, but Fe was also registered in places of higher concentration.
Cu was mostly registered incorrectly because the escape photons of the $L_{\alpha}$ spectral line of Pb (7.59 keV) have energy close to the $K_{\alpha}$ line (8.05 keV) of Cu. 
This particular line was not included in the training process, so adding it could potentially improve the results.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Classification Of Small Regions}
Another option was to classify single spectra or spectra averaged over small regions, e.g. $10\times10$ points. 
Savitzky–Golay filter was used to smooth spectra before further processing.
Also, extrapolation step was omitted during preprocessing to reduce computational cost.
Example spectra are shown in \prettyref{fig:spectra}.
